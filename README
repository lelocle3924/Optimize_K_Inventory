This repository implements the heuristic in this paper: Zhang, R., Kaku, I., & Xiao, Y. (2012). Model and heuristic algorithm of the joint replenishment problem with complete backordering and correlated demand. International Journal of Production Economics, 139(1), 33-41.


1. Run generate_test_case.py to generate test cases
    cases are saved in generate/generated_test_cases folder
2. to run base case with k=1
    run inventory_env.py
3. Run optimize_k_batch.py to optimize K
    set config.BATCH = True
    set config.USE_HEURISTIC_N = False
4. to run Heuristic_N
    set config.BATCH = True
    set config.USE_HEURISTIC_N = True
5. To run a single file for testing:
    run optimize_k_batch.py
    set config.BATCH = False
    set config.single_file = "*.csv"
    To plot results:
    set config.PLOT = True

6. To run sensitivity analysis:
    run test_N_minors.py -> see results in sensitivity_results folder
    run test_q_threshold.py -> see results in sensitivity_results folder

Results for batch run are stored in batch_results folder
Results for single run are stored in logs folder
